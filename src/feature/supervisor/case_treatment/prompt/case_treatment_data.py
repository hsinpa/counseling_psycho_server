1. Cognitive Laddering Steps:
Awareness of Automatic Thought: This involves identifying negative automatic thoughts and the connection between these thoughts and emotional or behavioral responses. It also includes helping the client improve self-awareness through journaling or reviewing specific situations.
Identification of Cognitive Distortions: Assists the client in recognizing thinking biases and developing an understanding that "thoughts are not facts."
Challenging Irrational Beliefs: Guides the client to examine the rationality, logic, and practicality of their beliefs using Socratic questioning to promote cognitive flexibility.
Generating Balanced Thoughts: Encourages the use of flexible phrasing to develop more neutral, positive, and constructive alternative thoughts. For example: “Even though..., I can still...”
Behavioral Experiments: Uses real-life scenarios to test and evaluate alternative thoughts.
Internalization and Consolidation: Strengthens new ways of thinking and integrates them into daily life through reflection and practice.
Cognitive Laddering: Involves exploring from specific events to uncover deeper core beliefs.

2. Emotional Hierarchy Ladder:
Emotional Awareness: Teach the client to recognize their own emotions and build a connection with them, helping them identify “What am I feeling right now?”
Emotional Intensity Assessment (SUDS Scale): Use the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (0–100) to help the client differentiate which situations trigger higher emotional responses, aiding in the creation of the emotional ladder.
Emotional Hierarchy Building: Arrange exposure tasks from low to high emotional intensity, assisting the client in developing a sense of control and achievement.
Emotional Exposure & Support: Guide the client to face emotionally triggering situations in a safe environment, offering support throughout the process.
Emotion Regulation Skills: Help the client learn not to avoid intense emotions but to face and manage them using practical techniques.
Cognitive Reframing: Address the beliefs and thoughts behind the emotions, rebuilding the meaning of the situation and the client’s sense of self-worth.
Reinforcement & Integration: After completing each stage of exposure, provide positive feedback and encourage self-celebration. Support the client in documenting physical and emotional changes experienced upon completion.
Relapse Planning: Simulate potential future scenarios and create a response plan, establishing a reusable "self-soothing strategy kit."

3. Behavioral-Level Hierarchy:
Graded Task Assignment: Break down large goals into small, manageable steps. Start with simple, low-pressure, and easily achievable actions to gradually build confidence and motivation.
Behavioral Activation: Improve mood, quality of life, and sense of self-efficacy by increasing engagement in meaningful and value-driven activities.
Feasibility and Mastery: Assess the individual’s current energy level to avoid setting goals that are too ambitious or abstract.
Positive Reinforcement: Strengthen behaviors through positive feedback, either via self-rewards or external support.
Monitoring and Logging: Use behavior tracking forms to monitor emotions and track progress.
Flexibility and Backup Plan: If the individual is unable to complete a step due to low mood or unexpected stress, allow a temporary return to a previous step or adjust the goal intensity to prevent treatment dropout due to feelings of failure.
Value-based and Personalized Goals: Ensure that all behavior plans are connected to the individual’s core values and life direction.
